<p>Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Fahim, an aspiring <strong>Data Scientist</strong> on a mission to transform data into stories and solutions. 
    Every dataset holds a puzzle, and I thrive on the challenge of decoding itâ€”whether through machine learning, statistical analysis, or creative visualization.</p>

<p>This website is where I document my <strong>projects, experiments, and discoveries</strong>, 
    sharing not just the results but the thought process, challenges, and lessons behind each one. 
    Data science, to me, is more than algorithms. Itâ€™s about curiosity, problem-solving, and making an impact.</p>

<p class="mb-5">My journey wouldnâ€™t be possible without the unwavering support of my family. 
    To my late mother, <strong>Azyanah Termudi</strong>â€”your resilience and love continue to inspire me every day. 
    To my wife, <strong>Nur Hidayah Merican</strong>, thank you for standing by me through late-night coding sessions and endless "aha!" moments. 
    And to my little <strong>Daim Hayyan</strong>, whose laughter reminds me why growth mattersâ€”this is for all of you. 
    <strong>"Abang will keep going."</strong></p>
