<p>Hi there! 👋 I'm Fahim, an aspiring <strong>Data Scientist</strong> 📊 on a mission to transform data into stories and solutions. 
    Every dataset holds a puzzle 🧩, and I thrive on the challenge of decoding it—whether through machine learning 🤖, statistical analysis 📈, or creative visualization 🎨.</p>

<p>This website is my <strong>knowledge hub</strong> 💻, where I document my projects, experiments, and discoveries 🔍, 
    sharing not just the results but the thought process 💭, challenges 🚧, and lessons learned 📚. 
    Data science, to me, is more than algorithms—it's about curiosity ❓, problem-solving 🛠️, and making an impact ✨.</p>

<p class="mb-5">My journey wouldn't be possible without the unwavering support of my family 👨👩👦. 
    To my late mother, <strong>Azyanah Termudi</strong> 👼—your resilience and love continue to inspire me every day 🌻. 
    To my wife, <strong>Nur Hidayah Merican</strong> 💖, thank you for standing by me through late-night coding sessions 🌙 and endless "aha!" moments 💡. 
    And to my little <strong>Daim Hayyan</strong> 👶, whose laughter reminds me why growth matters—this is for all of you. 
    <strong>"Abang will keep going."</strong> 🚀</p>
